<h1>Intro</h1>
<b1>This idea came up when I was moving from Florida my friends joked about having a Traebot to talk to since I wouldn't have my pc to play games with. 
This bot uses a seq2seq rnn model. The dataset that was used was interactions and messages used in the platform Discord. 
Since I only had one area to collect data from I used some data from the movie corpus data located in the pycharm links below. I think the model performed okay for the limited data I had I would love to get and collect more.
For personal reasons, I will not be adding the dataset used to the GitHub repo to avoid getting any personal info leaked.</b1>
